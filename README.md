# Does the text sentiment of the voting question influences the outcome of Swiss voting?

This repository includes the Swissvotes Dataset with history data regarding Swiss voting results, as well as a replication package, to replicate my results for data exploration and text sentiment analysis on the Swiss vote metadata.

Please install the required Python packages using requirements.txt
Installing the packages listed in the first cell of replication.ipynb should allow the replication of the results and plots.

Afterwards each cell in replication.ipynb should be working and produce the plots and results presented in my paper.

If some of the models and checkpoints can not be downloaded in a first try, please try again. Sometimes the download fails for some reason.
