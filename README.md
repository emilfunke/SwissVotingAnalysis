# Does the text sentiment of the voting question influences the outcome of Swiss voting?

This repository includes the Swissvotes Dataset with history data regarding Swiss voting results, as well as a replication package, to replicate my results for data exploration and text sentiment analysis on the Swiss vote metadata.

Please install the required Python packages using requirements.txt, or install the following packages at least:
  transformers
  germansentiment
  pandas
  numpy
  tqdm
  searborn
  matplotlib
  sentence_transformers
Using those, most of the code should be replicatable.

Afterwards each cell in replication.ipynb should be working and produce the plots and results presented in my paper.

If some of the models and checkpoints can not be downloaded in a first try, please try again. Sometimes the download fails for some reason.
